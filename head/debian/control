Description: IMAP/Maildir synchronization and reader support
 OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify your e-mail reading.  With
 OfflimeIMAP, you can:
 .
 * Read the same mailbox from multiple computers, and have your
   changes (deletions, etc.) be automatically reflected on
   all computers
 .
 * Use various mail clients to read a single mail box
 .
 * Read mail while offline (on a laptop) and have all changes
   synchronized when you get connected again
 .
 * Read IMAP mail with mail readers that do not support IMAP
 .
 * Use SSL (secure connections) to read IMAP mail even if your reader
   doesn't support SSL
 .
 * Synchronize your mail using a completely safe and fault-tolerant
   algorithm.  (At least I think it is!)
 .
 In short, OfflineIMAP is a tool to let you read mail how YOU want to.
