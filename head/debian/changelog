offlineimap (2.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the IMAP folder to use SELECT rather than STATUS more often.
    Makes the code more robust; handles better with read-only folders;
    and runs faster, especially for non-threaded useres, where it
    may eliminate up to 2-3 commands per folder.
  * Made sure IMAP folder savemessage() does a select.  This was a possible
    bug.
  * Modified Maildir folder to unlink messages with T flag in
    cachemessagelist()

offlineimap (2.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed imaplib.py to work better with read-only folders.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 Jul 2002 20:24:21 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for holdconnectionopen and keepalive.  This feature
    allows for an IMAP server connection(s) to be held open until
    the next sync process, permitting faster restart times.
  * Another try at read-only folder support.  This is nasty because I
    have no way to test it and imaplib's read-only support is weird.
  * Closing out old bug; fixed in 1.0.2.  Closes: #150803.
  * Optimized algorithm so that a SELECT is never issued for folders
    that contain no messages.

offlineimap (2.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a folderfilter example.  Partially fixes #152079.
  * Added folderincludes capability.  Partially fixes #152079.
  * More fixes for read-only folders.

offlineimap (2.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made OfflineIMAP at least rudimentarily compatible with read-only
    folders.  It will still fail if they get modified locally, though.
  * Flags are handled case-insensitively.  Closes: #151993.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri,  5 Jul 2002 09:10:29 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for specifying references.  Closes: #151960.
  * Added -d command-line option to enable imaplib debugging.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 20:39:29 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for remotepassfile.  Closes: #151943.
  * Added support for preauth tunnels.

offlineimap (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with not properly propogating foldersep changes.
    Now, local folders and status folders properly use the foldersep
    mechanism.  This corrects a problem with Exchange servers.
  * Wrote a major new thread montiring subsystem, defined a new
    ExitNotifyThread.  Handling of Ctrl-C now occurs within 1 second
    rather than after the whole program terminates.  Exceptions that
    occur in a thread are now caught by the main thread and marshalled
    over into the UI side of things for dispatch.  The entire program will
    now abort when one thread dies with an exception.

offlineimap (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This code is now multithreaded.  New config file options control the
    behavior.  This can make synchronizing several times faster.
  * Fixed the STATUS call to be compatible with Exchange.
  * Added the ability to exclude folders.
  * If upgrading from 1.0.x, you will need to add maxsyncaccounts to the
    general section and maxconnections to each account sections.
    There is also a new folderfilter option.
    You can find examples of all of these in the new offlineimap.conf
    example file packaged with the distribution.
  * The Debian package now properly installs the example offlineimap.conf
    file.
  * There is a new mailing list available.  To join, send SUBSCRIBE
    to offlineimap-request@complete.org.  The posting address is
    offlineimap@complete.org.

offlineimap (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deletion of more than one message has been optimized.  This could make
    deleting large numbers of messages far faster -- several orders of
    magnitude.
  * Moved more sleep code into ui layer.  Fancier sleep actions are now
    possible.  Better handling of Ctrl-C in TTY handler.

offlineimap (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug when a message was deleted on the IMAP side and modified
    on the local side.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 19:08:21 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made sure that LocalStatus does writing atomically.  If the program
    is interrupted during save(), there will always be a complete copy of
    either the old or the new data.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 06:57:28 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with writing messages to some IMAP servers.  Turns
    out we need to issue CHECK between APPEND and SEARCH for some.
    Thanks to Donovan Lange for reporting this bug and helping track it
    down.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 21 Jun 2002 22:03:12 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.  Closes: #150571.
