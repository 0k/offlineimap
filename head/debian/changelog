offlineimap (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made sure that LocalStatus does writing atomically.  If the program
    is interrupted during save(), there will always be a complete copy of
    either the old or the new data.

    Thanks to Donovan Lange for reporting this bug and helping track it
    down.
