offlineimap (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This code is now multithreaded.  New config file options control the
    behavior.  This can make synchronizing several times faster.
  * Fixed the STATUS call to be compatible with Exchange.
  * Added the ability to exclude folders.
  * If upgrading from 1.0.x, you will need to add maxsyncaccounts to the
    general section and maxconnections to each account sections.
    There is also a new folderfilter option.
    You can find examples of all of these in the new offlineimap.conf
    example file packaged with the distribution.
  * The Debian package now properly installs the example offlineimap.conf
    file.
  * There is a new mailing list available.  To join, send SUBSCRIBE
    to offlineimap-request@complete.org.  The posting address is
    offlineimap@complete.org.

offlineimap (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deletion of more than one message has been optimized.  This could make
    deleting large numbers of messages far faster -- several orders of
    magnitude.
  * Moved more sleep code into ui layer.  Fancier sleep actions are now
    possible.  Better handling of Ctrl-C in TTY handler.

offlineimap (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

    on the local side.

offlineimap (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made sure that LocalStatus does writing atomically.  If the program
    is interrupted during save(), there will always be a complete copy of
    either the old or the new data.

    Thanks to Donovan Lange for reporting this bug and helping track it
    down.
