[general]

# This specifies where offlineimap is to store its metadata.
# This directory will be created if it does not already exist.

metadata = ~/.offlineimap

# This variable specifies which accounts are defined.  Separate them
# with commas.  Account names should be alphanumeric only.
# You will need to specify one section per account below.  You may
# not use "general" for an account name.

accounts = Test

# You can have offlineimap continue running indefinately, automatically
# syncing your mail periodically.  If you want that, specify how
# frequently to do that (in minutes) here.

# autorefresh = 5

# Offlineimap can synchronize more the one account at a time.  If you
# want to enable this feature, set the below value to something
# greater than 1.  To force it to synchronize only one account at a
# time, leave it at 1.

# Mailbox name recorder
##################################################

[mbnames]

# offlineimap can record your mailbox names in a format you specify.
# You can define the header, each mailbox item, the separator,
# and the footer.  Here is an example for Mutt.
# If enabled is yes, all six setting must be specified, even if they
# are just the empty string "".
#
# The header, peritem, sep, and footer are all Python expressions passed
# through eval, so you can (and must) use Python quoting.

# This is an account definition clause.  You'll have one of these
# for each account listed in general/accounts above.

[Test]
# Specify the remote hostname.

# Whether or not to use SSL.
ssl = yes

# Specify the port.  If not specified, use a default port.
# remoteport = 993

# Specify the remote user name.
remoteuser = username

# Specify the remote password.  If not specified, you will be
# prompted.
# remotepass = fake

# Specify local repository.

localfolders = ~/Test

# You can specify a folder translator.  This must be a eval-able
# Python expression that takes a foldername arg and returns the new
# value.  I suggest a lambda.  This example will remove "INBOX." from
# the leading edge of folders (great for Courier IMAP users)

# nametrans = lambda foldername: re.sub('^INBOX.', '', foldername)

# OfflineIMAP can use multiple connections to the server in order
# to perform multiple synchronization actions simultaneously.
# This may place a higher burden on the server.  In most cases,
# setting this value to 2 or 3 will speed up the sync, but in some
# cases, it may slow things down.  The safe answer is 1.  You should
# probably never set it to a value more than 5.
