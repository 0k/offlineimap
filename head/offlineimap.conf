# This directory will be created if it does not already exist.

metadata = ~/.imapsync

# This variable specifies which accounts are defined.  Separate them
# with commas.  Account names should be alphanumeric only.
# You will need to specify one section per account below.  You may
# not use "general" for an account name.

# You can have imapsync continue running indefinately, automatically
# syncing your mail periodically.  If you want that, specify how
# frequently to do that (in minutes) here.

# Mailbox name recorder

[mbnames]

# imapsync can record your mailbox names in a format you specify.
# You can define the header, each mailbox item, the separator,
# and the footer.  Here is an example for Mutt.
# If enabled is yes, all six setting must be specified, even if they
# are just the empty string "".
#
# The header, peritem, sep, and footer are all Python expressions passed
# through eval, so you can (and must) use Python quoting.

# Specify the port.  If not specified, use a default port.

# You can specify a folder translator.  This must be a eval-able
# Python expression that takes a foldername arg and returns the new
# value.  I suggest a lambda.  This example will remove "INBOX." from
# the leading edge of folders (great for Courier IMAP users)

# nametrans = lambda foldername: re.sub('^INBOX.', '', foldername)
