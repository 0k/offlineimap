# Description

Welcome to the official OfflineIMAP project.

OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify your e-mail reading. With OfflineIMAP, you can
read the same mailbox from multiple computers. You get a current copy of your
messages on each computer, and changes you make one place will be visible on all
other systems. For instance, you can delete a message on your home computer, and
it will appear deleted on your work computer as well. OfflineIMAP is also useful
if you want to use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP
support, or does not provide disconnected operation.

OfflineIMAP works on pretty much any POSIX operating system, such as Linux, BSD
operating systems, MacOS X, Solaris, etc.

OfflineIMAP is a Free Software project licensed under the GNU General Public
License. You can download it for free, and you can modify it. In fact, you are
encouraged to contribute to OfflineIMAP, and doing so is fast and easy.

This software was written by John Goerzen, who retired from maintaining. It is
now maintained by Nicolas Sebrecht.
