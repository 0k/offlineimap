offlineimap (3.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * When uploading messages from a Maildir, now convert \r\n to \n in case
    the message is stored weirdly.  That way, everything is uniform.
    Fixes [complete.org #11].
  * Manual: added UW IMAPD example with references from docwhat@gerf.org.
  * New UI modules: Noninteractive.Basic and Noninteractive.Quiet.
    Fixes [complete.org #14].
  * Added per-thread profiling support to aid in debugging.

offlineimap (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer throws an exception when updating messages with strange
    Date headers; will just set IMAP Internaldate to the current date.
    Closes: #153425.
  * No longer doubles-up reference names for mailboxes.  Closes: #153515.
  * Noted new bug-tracking system in manual and rebuilt manual files.
  * Now stores incoming messages in 'cur' instead of 'new' if they have
    the S flag.  Closes: #152482.

offlineimap (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mailbox name recorder to use localfolder.getvisiblename() rather
    than remotefolder.getvisiblename()
  * Fixed remotepassfile option.  Closes: #153119.  Used 1-line patch from
    Tommi Virtanen.
  * Now handles cases of not being able to get UID for an uploaded message
    more gracefully.  This could occur if the server doesn't support
    SEARCH, can't find the message ID, or finds multiple message IDs.
    Closes: #153241.
  * Now source is in Subversion.  Make version.py log the Subversion
    revision number.

offlineimap (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Detabified the source.
  * Added UI list to the manpage.
  * Added -o (run only once) option with patch sent in by Martijn Pieters.
  * Optimized folder/IMAP.py addmessagesflags() with new listjoin() in
    imaputil.  Now, send the server 1:5,7 instead of 1,2,3,4,5,7.
  * Made folder/Maildir.py/deletemessage() more tolerant if a message
    asked to be deleted already has been.
  * In Base.py/copymessageto(), no longer bother calling getmessage()
    unless a folder's storemessages() returns true.  This will also help
    with syncing to LocalStatus if the user deleted messages in the
    Maildir since the cachemessagelist() was called.

offlineimap (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced a new graphical user interface written with Tkinter.
    It features a nice view of multi-threaded displays.
  * The TTY user interface now also displays thread names.
  * Program-wide, new threads are given descriptive names to aid in
    debugging and status messages.
  * Added new module offlineimap/ui/detect.py that is used to detect
    which user interface to select for a given session.  Its operation
    is governed by the ui config option and the -u command-line option.
  * Made IMAP folder addmessagesflags() resiliant to a server refusing
    to return a full set of new message flags.  Closes: #152587.
  * Completely rewrote documentation.  OfflineIMAP now has an
    exhaustive manpage, which is really a manual.  It is also shipped
    in plain text, HTML, PDF, and PostScript formats.
  * New command-line options:
    -1 to force no multi-threaded operation
    -u to force a particular UI
    -a to specify which accounts to sync
    -h to print help
    -c to specify an alternate config file
  * Added a workaround for UW IMAP problem wherein the server loses
    uidvalidity whenever a folder is emptied.  Now, the program
    will not consider it a problem if uidvalidity is lost when a folder
    and the local status cache are both completely empty, since we do
    not really need to preserve uidvalidity in that case anyway.
    Closes: #152079.

offlineimap (2.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the IMAP folder to use SELECT rather than STATUS more often.
    Makes the code more robust; handles better with read-only folders;
    and runs faster, especially for non-threaded useres, where it
    may eliminate up to 2-3 commands per folder.
  * Made sure IMAP folder savemessage() does a select.  This was a possible
    bug.
  * Modified Maildir folder to unlink messages with T flag in
    cachemessagelist()
  * My own box now syncs in 3 seconds.
  * Optimized acquireconnection() to try to give a thread back the
    connection that it last used, if possible.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue, 9 Jul 2002 23:29:30 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed imaplib.py to work better with read-only folders.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 Jul 2002 20:24:21 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for holdconnectionopen and keepalive.  This feature
    allows for an IMAP server connection(s) to be held open until
    the next sync process, permitting faster restart times.
  * Another try at read-only folder support.  This is nasty because I
    have no way to test it and imaplib's read-only support is weird.
  * Closing out old bug; fixed in 1.0.2.  Closes: #150803.
  * Optimized algorithm so that a SELECT is never issued for folders
    that contain no messages.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 Jul 2002 20:05:24 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a folderfilter example.  Partially fixes #152079.
  * Added folderincludes capability.  Partially fixes #152079.
  * More fixes for read-only folders.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri,  5 Jul 2002 09:21:52 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made OfflineIMAP at least rudimentarily compatible with read-only
    folders.  It will still fail if they get modified locally, though.
  * Flags are handled case-insensitively.  Closes: #151993.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri,  5 Jul 2002 09:10:29 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for specifying references.  Closes: #151960.
  * Added -d command-line option to enable imaplib debugging.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 20:39:29 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for remotepassfile.  Closes: #151943.
  * Added support for preauth tunnels.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 14:46:23 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with not properly propogating foldersep changes.
    Now, local folders and status folders properly use the foldersep
    mechanism.  This corrects a problem with Exchange servers.
  * Wrote a major new thread montiring subsystem, defined a new
    ExitNotifyThread.  Handling of Ctrl-C now occurs within 1 second
    rather than after the whole program terminates.  Exceptions that
    occur in a thread are now caught by the main thread and marshalled
    over into the UI side of things for dispatch.  The entire program will
    now abort when one thread dies with an exception.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 09:07:06 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This code is now multithreaded.  New config file options control the
    behavior.  This can make synchronizing several times faster.
  * Fixed the STATUS call to be compatible with Exchange.
  * Added the ability to exclude folders.
  * If upgrading from 1.0.x, you will need to add maxsyncaccounts to the
    general section and maxconnections to each account sections.
    There is also a new folderfilter option.
    You can find examples of all of these in the new offlineimap.conf
    example file packaged with the distribution.
  * The Debian package now properly installs the example offlineimap.conf
    file.
  * There is a new mailing list available.  To join, send SUBSCRIBE
    to offlineimap-request@complete.org.  The posting address is
    offlineimap@complete.org.

offlineimap (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deletion of more than one message has been optimized.  This could make
    deleting large numbers of messages far faster -- several orders of
    magnitude.
  * Moved more sleep code into ui layer.  Fancier sleep actions are now
    possible.  Better handling of Ctrl-C in TTY handler.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  2 Jul 2002 19:16:04 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug when a message was deleted on the IMAP side and modified
    on the local side.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 19:08:21 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made sure that LocalStatus does writing atomically.  If the program
    is interrupted during save(), there will always be a complete copy of
    either the old or the new data.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 06:57:28 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with writing messages to some IMAP servers.  Turns
    out we need to issue CHECK between APPEND and SEARCH for some.
    Thanks to Donovan Lange for reporting this bug and helping track it
    down.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 21 Jun 2002 22:03:12 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.  Closes: #150571.
