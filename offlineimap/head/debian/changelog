offlineimap (3.99.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * This a 4.0 TRACK release, and may be unstable or in flux!
  * Completed work to make both graphical interfaces work 
    with a threaded Tcl/Tk Tkinter.  A threaded Tcl/Tk actually makes
    life MORE difficult for multi-threaded Python programs, argh.
  * Now properly handles folder names that contain parenthesis.  Used
    patch from Kyler Laird in
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=173895.
    Closes: #173895.	
  * Changed to a more account-centric behavior.  The refresh time is now
    a per-account variable.  Implemented new account classes.  User
    interfaces must now be updated to take advantage of this.
    *** NOTE *** THIS CHANGE BREAKS COMPATIBILITY WITH OLDER VERSIONS.
  * New color console interface: Curses.Blinkenlights!  Try it out!
    Closes: #167357.
  * Due to possibly having one account sleep while another is reading a
    password, and other tricky situations, support for nice updating and
    cancelling of a sleep in TTY.TTYUI has been removed.  (Sleep will
    still work; there is just no way to cancel it early.)
    .
    However, this is not going to be a huge problem because the new Curses
    Blinkenlights interface has this support, and does it a lot better than
    TTY.TTYUI ever could have.
  * Provided config file default for many more options.  Closes: #168219.
  * New example file offlineimap.conf.minimal showing you how to get started
    fast.  It uses only 6 lines to set up an account.

offlineimap (3.99.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ability to disable expunging on the server.
  * Fixed infinite loop with preauth.  Closes: #169514, #171485.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue, 03 Dec 2002 06:22:37 -0600

offlineimap (3.99.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed setup.py installation instructions.
  * Added more debugging to the CRAM-MD5 authentication module.
  * CRAM-MD5 *really* fixed this time.  Thanks to MJ for the patch.
  * Adding missing import os to imapserver.py.  Thanks to John Wiegley
    for catching that.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  5 Nov 2002 08:06:45 -0600

offlineimap (3.99.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved password promting into imapserver.py.  Passwords are now asked
    for on-demand and typos will no longer crash the program (the user
    will be re-prompted).  Closes: #162672.
  * Falls back to plain-text auth if CRAM-MD5 fails.  Fixes [complete.org #42]
  * Fixed CRAM-MD5 auth so it actually works now.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon,  4 Nov 2002 06:16:11 -0600

offlineimap (3.99.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further attempts to fix imapsplit problems.
  * When an exception occurs, OfflineIMAP will attempt to print the last
    50 debug messages, whether or not debugging was enabled for this
    session.  This way, even unexpected and non-repeatable errors stand
    a chance of getting a more detailed log.
  * Handle uidvalidity file in an atomic fashion.  CLoses: #165600.
  * Supports CRAM-MD5 authentication.  Fixes [complete.org #38], and for
    Debian, Closes: #154165.
  * Noted CRAM-MD5 support in the "CONFORMING TO" section of the manual.
  * Certain servers may not always return the UID flag for new messages.
    This causes an OfflineIMAP exception, though rerunning will fix it.
    Now, OfflineIMAP will detect the condition and ignore the offending
    messages (without an exception) until the next sync.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Sat, 02 Nov 2002 10:23:10 -0600

offlineimap (3.99.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some syntax errors in imaputil.py
  * Fixed a syntax error with mbnames

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed,  9 Oct 2002 19:34:37 -0500

offlineimap (3.99.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The next few releases are adding features and reorganizing
    code in preparation for 4.0.0.
  * imaputil.py now logs information with IMAP debugging is enabled.
  * Added folderfilter capability to mbnames recorder.  You can now omit
    specified folders from the mbnames output.
  * Added a workaround to imaputil.py to deal with a bug in imaplib.py's
    tuple when a response contains a literal in certain cases.
  * Split out the code in bin/offlineimap into offlineimap/init.py.
    Retaining bin/offlineimap as a skeletal piece only.  Contains
    about three lines of code now.  This will make many things
    easier, including debugging.
  * Added library version check to bin/offlineimap and
    offlineimap/init.py.
  * Moved __main__.ui to functions in UIBase: getglobalui() and
    setglobalui().
  * Added license comments to some source files that were missing them.
  * Moved some code from offlineimap/init.py to new file
    offlineimap/syncmaster.py to help dileneate between code that
    performs different functions.
  * Moved threadexited from offlineimap/init.py to
    offlineimap/threadutil.py.
  * offlineimap.py is back to ease the use of OfflineIMAP in single-user
    installations.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 07 Oct 2002 05:08:08 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a work-around for some IMAP servers that respond poorly
    to LIST "" "".  It will now do LIST "" "*", for them only.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 30 Sep 2002 10:48:01 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved executable to bin/offlineimap.  This will allow setup.py to
    properly install it as offlineimap instead of offlineimap.py.
  * Made sure executables use /usr/bin/env in bangpath.
  * Font size for Blinkenlights interface is now configurable.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu, 19 Sep 2002 06:46:56 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed indentation in debian/control.  Closes: #156327.
  * Removed calls to folder object deletions.  None have been implemented
    anyway.
  * folder/Maildir.py: unlink throws OSError, not IOError; fixed.
    Now handles message deleting race condition properly.
    Closes: #154497.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 16 Aug 2002 17:43:19 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now handles uploading messages without Message-Id headers.
    Closes: #156022.
  * Applied patch from Tommi Virtanen that adds two new config file
    options: pythonfile and foldersort.  Fixes [complete.org #29], and
    for Debian, Closes: #155637.
  * Added documentation for the above features.
  * Even more resiliant in the face of invalid Date headers.  Closes: #155994.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri,  9 Aug 2002 17:54:01 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * When using nested folders, the Maildir repository handler now properly
    deals with folders that are nested inside "noselect" folders -- ones
    that do not actually contain messages and are not provided in the
    server's LIST response.  Fixes [complete.org #32] and, for Debian,
    Closes: #155866.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  8 Aug 2002 17:54:44 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * -d now takes a parameter: imap or maildir (or both) to specify
    what type of debugging to do.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  8 Aug 2002 10:02:36 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manual to show new Gray color.
  * Scrolling behavior is better now; sometimes, with fast-scrolling text,
    the log would stop scrolling.
  * Better handling of read-only folders.  We will now warn if there is
    a change, but not propogate it.  New config variable ignore-readonly
    can suppress the warnings.  This fixes [complete.org #10] and,
    for Debian, Closes: #154769.
  * If a given Maildir folder is new, remove the associated local status
    cache file, if any.  That way, there will not be any chance of
    propogating hordes of deletes and adds based on old status data.
  * Added support for /-separated Maildirs -- that is, hierarchical
    Maildir trees.  Fixes [complete.org #28] and, for Debian,
    Closes: #155460.
  * Preventitive security: Folder names may not contain ./ or start with /.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed, 07 Aug 2002 20:22:25 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * There is a new "connecting" event that will appear in all but the
    Quiet UIs.  It has a gray color in Blinkenlights.  This event indicates
    the the program is connecting to a remote server.
  * Blinkenlights UI log window is now scrolled and has a new
    config file option "bufferlines" to specify the size of the scroll
    buffer.
  * The Blinkenlights window is now non-resizable when the log is disabled.
    When the log is enabled, the window is resizable, and the changes in
    size are reflected in the log widget.  Therefore, the Bigger Log
    and Smaller Log items can disappear, and the Log menu now becomes
    a Show Log or a Hide Log menu option.  No sub-menus necessary anymore.
    This presents a much cleaner feel, more intuitive operation, and
    faster navigation.
  * Fix for account name interpolation in dot warning from 3.2.0 from
    Martijn Pieters.
  * Backed out check for . in account names for now.  Will put it back in
    when we have a consensus on what exactly to do.  Doubt that anyone
    has a foldername that would conflict with Blinkenlights anyway.
  * Fix reading the ui.Tk.Blinkenlights bufferlines option.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed, 24 Jul 2002 17:04:04 -0500

offlineimap (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New BLINKENLIGHTS interface!  Mesmerising, isn't it?
  * New ui.Tk.Blinkenlights section in offlineimap.conf.
  * New USER INTERFACES section in the manual.
  * TTYUI isusable() now checks to see if stdout and stdin are TTYs.
  * Added build-dependency on python2.2-dev.  Closes: #154167.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed, 24 Jul 2002 17:53:20 -0500

offlineimap (3.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified imaputil.py and folder/Maildir.py to run faster.  Eliminated
    many regular expressions; pre-compiled many others.
  * Fixed threadutil's exitnotifyloop to always handle threads in the order
    they exited, rather than sometimes in the inverse order.  This way,
    make sure to handle thread's exception messages before a thread exited.
  * Replaced imaplib.py's braindead readline() with a more efficient one.
  * More optimizations to imaputil and folders for faster operation.
  * These optimizations, all together, have resulted in OfflineIMAP
    using approximately half the CPU time of previous versions, fixing
    [complete.org #6], and... Closes: #153503.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed, 24 Jul 2002 06:53:16 -0500

offlineimap (3.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * When uploading messages from a Maildir, now convert \r\n to \n in case
    the message is stored weirdly.  That way, everything is uniform.
    Fixes [complete.org #11].
  * Manual: added UW IMAPD example with references from docwhat@gerf.org.
  * New UI modules: Noninteractive.Basic and Noninteractive.Quiet.
    Fixes [complete.org #14].
  * Added per-thread profiling support to aid in debugging.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Sun, 21 Jul 2002 16:09:42 -0500

offlineimap (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer throws an exception when updating messages with strange
    Date headers; will just set IMAP Internaldate to the current date.
    Closes: #153425.
  * No longer doubles-up reference names for mailboxes.  Closes: #153515.
  * Noted new bug-tracking system in manual and rebuilt manual files.
  * Now stores incoming messages in 'cur' instead of 'new' if they have
    the S flag.  Closes: #152482.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Sun, 21 Jul 2002 13:46:13 -0500

offlineimap (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mailbox name recorder to use localfolder.getvisiblename() rather
    than remotefolder.getvisiblename()
  * Fixed remotepassfile option.  Closes: #153119.  Used 1-line patch from
    Tommi Virtanen.
  * Now handles cases of not being able to get UID for an uploaded message
    more gracefully.  This could occur if the server doesn't support
    SEARCH, can't find the message ID, or finds multiple message IDs.
    Closes: #153241.
  * Now source is in Subversion.  Make version.py log the Subversion
    revision number.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed, 15 Jul 2002 06:43:36 -0500

offlineimap (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Detabified the source.
  * Added UI list to the manpage.
  * Added -o (run only once) option with patch sent in by Martijn Pieters.
  * Optimized folder/IMAP.py addmessagesflags() with new listjoin() in
    imaputil.  Now, send the server 1:5,7 instead of 1,2,3,4,5,7.
  * Made folder/Maildir.py/deletemessage() more tolerant if a message
    asked to be deleted already has been.
  * In Base.py/copymessageto(), no longer bother calling getmessage()
    unless a folder's storemessages() returns true.  This will also help
    with syncing to LocalStatus if the user deleted messages in the
    Maildir since the cachemessagelist() was called.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 12 Jul 2002 07:28:24 -0500

offlineimap (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced a new graphical user interface written with Tkinter.
    It features a nice view of multi-threaded displays.
  * The TTY user interface now also displays thread names.
  * Program-wide, new threads are given descriptive names to aid in
    debugging and status messages.
  * Added new module offlineimap/ui/detect.py that is used to detect
    which user interface to select for a given session.  Its operation
    is governed by the ui config option and the -u command-line option.
  * Made IMAP folder addmessagesflags() resiliant to a server refusing
    to return a full set of new message flags.  Closes: #152587.
  * Completely rewrote documentation.  OfflineIMAP now has an
    exhaustive manpage, which is really a manual.  It is also shipped
    in plain text, HTML, PDF, and PostScript formats.
  * New command-line options:
    -1 to force no multi-threaded operation
    -u to force a particular UI
    -a to specify which accounts to sync
    -h to print help
    -c to specify an alternate config file
  * Added a workaround for UW IMAP problem wherein the server loses
    uidvalidity whenever a folder is emptied.  Now, the program
    will not consider it a problem if uidvalidity is lost when a folder
    and the local status cache are both completely empty, since we do
    not really need to preserve uidvalidity in that case anyway.
    Closes: #152079.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu, 11 Jul 2002 22:35:42 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the IMAP folder to use SELECT rather than STATUS more often.
    Makes the code more robust; handles better with read-only folders;
    and runs faster, especially for non-threaded useres, where it
    may eliminate up to 2-3 commands per folder.
  * Made sure IMAP folder savemessage() does a select.  This was a possible
    bug.
  * Modified Maildir folder to unlink messages with T flag in
    cachemessagelist()
  * My own box now syncs in 3 seconds.
  * Optimized acquireconnection() to try to give a thread back the
    connection that it last used, if possible.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue, 9 Jul 2002 23:29:30 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed imaplib.py to work better with read-only folders.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 Jul 2002 20:24:21 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for holdconnectionopen and keepalive.  This feature
    allows for an IMAP server connection(s) to be held open until
    the next sync process, permitting faster restart times.
  * Another try at read-only folder support.  This is nasty because I
    have no way to test it and imaplib's read-only support is weird.
  * Closing out old bug; fixed in 1.0.2.  Closes: #150803.
  * Optimized algorithm so that a SELECT is never issued for folders
    that contain no messages.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  9 Jul 2002 20:05:24 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a folderfilter example.  Partially fixes #152079.
  * Added folderincludes capability.  Partially fixes #152079.
  * More fixes for read-only folders.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri,  5 Jul 2002 09:21:52 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made OfflineIMAP at least rudimentarily compatible with read-only
    folders.  It will still fail if they get modified locally, though.
  * Flags are handled case-insensitively.  Closes: #151993.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri,  5 Jul 2002 09:10:29 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for specifying references.  Closes: #151960.
  * Added -d command-line option to enable imaplib debugging.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 20:39:29 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for remotepassfile.  Closes: #151943.
  * Added support for preauth tunnels.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 14:46:23 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with not properly propogating foldersep changes.
    Now, local folders and status folders properly use the foldersep
    mechanism.  This corrects a problem with Exchange servers.
  * Wrote a major new thread montiring subsystem, defined a new
    ExitNotifyThread.  Handling of Ctrl-C now occurs within 1 second
    rather than after the whole program terminates.  Exceptions that
    occur in a thread are now caught by the main thread and marshalled
    over into the UI side of things for dispatch.  The entire program will
    now abort when one thread dies with an exception.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Thu,  4 Jul 2002 09:07:06 -0500

offlineimap (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * This code is now multithreaded.  New config file options control the
    behavior.  This can make synchronizing several times faster.
  * Fixed the STATUS call to be compatible with Exchange.
  * Added the ability to exclude folders.
  * If upgrading from 1.0.x, you will need to add maxsyncaccounts to the
    general section and maxconnections to each account sections.
    There is also a new folderfilter option.
    You can find examples of all of these in the new offlineimap.conf
    example file packaged with the distribution.
  * The Debian package now properly installs the example offlineimap.conf
    file.
  * There is a new mailing list available.  To join, send SUBSCRIBE
    to offlineimap-request@complete.org.  The posting address is
    offlineimap@complete.org.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Wed,  3 Jul 2002 19:21:32 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deletion of more than one message has been optimized.  This could make
    deleting large numbers of messages far faster -- several orders of
    magnitude.
  * Moved more sleep code into ui layer.  Fancier sleep actions are now
    possible.  Better handling of Ctrl-C in TTY handler.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue,  2 Jul 2002 19:16:04 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug when a message was deleted on the IMAP side and modified
    on the local side.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 19:08:21 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made sure that LocalStatus does writing atomically.  If the program
    is interrupted during save(), there will always be a complete copy of
    either the old or the new data.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 06:57:28 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a bug with writing messages to some IMAP servers.  Turns
    out we need to issue CHECK between APPEND and SEARCH for some.
    Thanks to Donovan Lange for reporting this bug and helping track it
    down.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Fri, 21 Jun 2002 22:03:12 -0500

offlineimap (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.  Closes: #150571.
